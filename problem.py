'''
  Problem: Nested Elements
  Find the average (mean) of all the numbers in a list, no matter how deeply nested.

  eg.
       average([1, [2, []], [[3, [4]]]])
       # expected output: 2.5

  You may assume that all elements are either lists or numbers
  and that lists are nested less than 1000 layers deep.
