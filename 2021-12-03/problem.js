/*
  Problem: Nested Elements
  Find the average (mean) of all the numbers in an array, no matter how deeply nested.

  eg.
       average([1, [2, []], [[3, [4]]]])
       // expected output: 2.5

  You may assume that all elements are either arrays or numbers
  and that arrays are nested less than 1000 layers deep.
