  Q1.  This function will be called with a list of dictionaries.
       Add up the numbers in the 'price' key multiplied by the 'quantity' key.
  eg.
       question1([{ 'price': 100, 'quantity': 2 }, { 'price': -10, quantity: 5 }])
       # expected output: 150

  Q2.  Capitalize every other character of a string, starting with a capital letter.
  eg.
       question2('Their name is: Erin.')
       # expected output: 'ThEiR NaMe iS: eRiN.'

  Q3.  Return the first n fibonacci numbers in a string separated by spaces.
  eg.
       question3(7)
       # expected output: '1 1 2 3 5 8 13'

  Q4.  Simplify the directions.  Given an array of cardinal directions ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West'),
       your task is to recursively remove all instances where North and South or East and West appear side by side.
  eg.
       question4(['North', 'East', 'South', 'West', 'East'])
       # expected output: ['North', 'East', 'South']
       question4(['North', 'South', 'South', 'East', 'West', 'North', 'West'])
       # expected output: ['West']

  Q5.  Make a histogram.  You will be given a list of values to make into a historgam as in the example below.
       There should be no trailing spaces at the end of a line, and each line including the last should end in a
       line break.
  eg.
       question5([7, 3, 10, 1, 0, 5])
       expected output:
    #
